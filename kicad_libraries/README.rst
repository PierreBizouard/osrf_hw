kicad_libraries
===============

This is the set of Kicad schlib files created on the fly according to our needs. Most of these libraries are not available in the Kicad official repository. 

Nevertheless some of them are duplicated from the official one to add all the parameters used to populate the BOM automatically according to the part database sotred in the kicad_script/db_files directory

Several of them have been generated automatically using the scripts generate_component.py or generate_multipart_components.py

These libraries are subjected to change often and to be refactored once a naming/sorting convention has been established
