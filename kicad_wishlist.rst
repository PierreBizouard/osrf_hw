kicad wishlist
==============
A set of features that I would like to see in kicad and may implement whenever I have time, this list is not organized by priority or workload it's just a bunch of ideas in a random order:

PCBNEW
------
- Net class/group highlighting
- Allow to change net in the track/via edit dialog box
- Allow user to define length matching margin for a given net/net class
- drag traces in OpenGL mode
- group routing

SCH/SCHLIB Editor
--------------------
- Unify functions between sch editor and SCHLib editor (copy block doesn't behave the same etc)
- Copy elements from one kicad instance to another
- set default grid to 100mil and pin text and name to 50mil to comply with KLC by default
