kicad_modules
=============

This is a set of kicad_mod files (footprints).

Most of them comply to KLC when it makes sense and do not comply for simplicity of use with other scripts and tools.

Most of them have been generated automatically using scripts. Most of those scripts are not published given that you need to tweak scripts for every component family you want to create.
